# Sovereign Cortex Initiativ≡ (SCI)

**Pronounced:** "Psy" (like *sci*-fi)  

The Sovereign Cortex Initiativ≡ is the federated **cortex** for **Semantic Origin Zero (Sem0)** — the umbrella where enforceable semantics, verifiable trust, and incorruptible execution converge.  
**Know (Pnode)** is the only **root grammar of civilization**: semantics indivisible, execution incorruptible.

## Genesis
Incomplete primitives breed incomplete realities. The current internet survives by keeping its core abstractions fragile — ensuring permanent reliance on intermediaries.  
**Semantic Origin Zero (Sem0)** must be **complete at its substrate**: semantics unambiguous, identity indivisible, execution incorruptible.  
Without this, every higher system inherits the same rot.

Sem0 anchors meaning the way language anchored culture: by making the ephemeral durable, and the durable incorruptible.  
*For the full creation narrative and substrate rationale, see the [Sem0 Genesis Note](Sem0-Genesis-Note.md).*  

SCI federates governance, semantics, identity, communications, and other critical primitives for a sovereign digital future — built on top of Know as the incorruptible substrate.

## Domains of Custody (Phase 1)
- **Semantics (Know / Pnode)** — glyph logic (human-readable v1 now, binary True Substrate Encoding (TSE) next)   
- **Identity & Attestation** — cryptographically provable, user-owned credentials  
- **Communications** — resilient, post-fragility network architectures  
- **Networks** — topology and routing systems for sovereign, failure-tolerant connectivity  
- **Data** — user-owned, ZKP-bound live verifiable endpoints, verified at the edge  
- **Security** — substrate-native defenses against capture, tampering, and unauthorized inference  
- **Compliance** — programmable, jurisdiction-aware enforcement that operates without central gatekeepers  
- **Planetary Systems** — environmental sensing, coordination, and control protocols  

---

## Structure
SCI operates as a **federated umbrella**:
- **Individual repos** for each council/domain (e.g., semantics, identity, networks, etc.).  
- **Baseline repos** are owned and maintained by the custodial entity that originated them.  
- **Suggestions layer** exists for each council — all contributions are reviewed by the originating custodian before merge.  
- No external actor (individual, institution, or council) can unilaterally alter a baseline repo. 

---

## Status (v1.0)
**Current:**  
- Foundational Note v1.0: defined, timestamped, and version-controlled.  
- Sem0 Genesis Note: defined, timestamped, and version-controlled.  
- Root grammar of civilization (Know/Layer0): hybrid glyph logic, TSE integration underway.  
- Councils: forming privately.  

**Next:**  
- Layer1 identity + attestation deployment.  
- Resilient network layer testbed.  
- OS-native execution kernel.  
- AI semantic-constraint framework.  

---

## Why this exists
SCI exists to invert the order of the internet: **semantics become enforceable, identity is user-owned and device-bound, and trust is programmable**.

## Core Documents
These texts form the **canonical base layer of SCI**. Each addresses a different dimension — sovereignty, substrate, clarity, and governance. Each is timestamped, versioned, and integrity-verified.  

- **[Foundational Note v1.0](Foundational-Note-v1.0.md)**  
  Defines SCI as federated cortex; Know as incorruptible root grammar of civilization. Establishes custodianship and succession rules.  

- **[Sem0 Genesis Note](Sem0-Genesis-Note.md)**  
  Outlines the creation narrative and rationale for Semantic Origin Zero (Sem0) as the incorruptible substrate of meaning.  

- **[Ontology](Ontology-v1.0.md)**  
  Provides precise definitions for key terms (SCI, Sem0, Know/Pnode, Layer0, etc.) to prevent semantic drift.  

- **[Council Charters](Council-Charters-v1.0.md)**  
  Describes the federated governance structure of SCI, domain-specific councils, and rules of participation.

**Breadcrumb:** Certain pathways in Pnode have no terminus here — they point upward into domains not yet disclosed.  
Those who can trace them will know where to look when the horizon shifts.
