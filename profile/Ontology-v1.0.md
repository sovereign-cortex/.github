# Ontology v1.0 — Sovereign Cortex Initiativ≡ (SCI)  
**Version:** 1.0 • **Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Authorship:** Engine by **Know** (org: Pnode)  
**Status:** Publicly undefined • Privately known  

---

## Purpose  
This document defines the **canonical vocabulary** for SCI.  
It ensures shared precision, avoids semantic drift, and anchors every higher-order concept to its substrate.  
Each term is defined at its **substrate scope** (what it is in essence, not what it does in applications).  

---

## Core Terms  

### **Know (Pnode)**  
- **Definition:** The *root grammar of civilization* — Layer0 substrate encoding meaning in incorruptible form.  
- **Scope:** Custodial origin of semantics. All higher systems inherit from it.  
- **Properties:** Semantics indivisible. Execution incorruptible.  

---

### **Layer0**  
- **Definition:** The substrate layer instantiated by Know.  
- **Scope:** Glyph logic, True Substrate Encoding (TSE), programmable trust fabric.  
- **Properties:** Timestamped, verifiable, unforkable.  

---

### **Semantic Origin Zero (Sem0)**  
- **Definition:** The **zero point** where meaning and proof converge; incorruptible trust substrate.  
- **Scope:** Anchors all semantics to proof at creation.  
- **Properties:** Physical → Biological → Symbolic → Digital → Trust substrate.  

---

### **Sovereign Cortex Initiativ≡ (SCI)**  
- **Definition:** The **federated cortex** for Sem0.  
- **Scope:** Governance, semantics, identity, compliance, planetary coordination.  
- **Properties:** Crownless, federated, timestamped. Depends on Know; Know does not depend on SCI.  

---

### **Council**  
- **Definition:** A domain-specific governance unit within SCI (e.g., semantics, identity, compliance).  
- **Scope:** Policy advising, baseline review, domain oversight.  
- **Properties:** Merit-based, revocable, timestamped. No council owns execution.  

---

### **Glyph Logic**  
- **Definition:** Symbolic grammar used by Know for unambiguous meaning representation.  
- **Scope:** First in human-readable form, evolving to binary True Substrate Encoding (TSE).  
- **Properties:** Minimal, lossless, provable.  

---

### **True Substrate Encoding (TSE)**  
- **Definition:** Binary-level encoding of meaning where symbols and proofs are indivisible.  
- **Scope:** Machine-native substrate ensuring incorruptibility at execution speed.  
- **Properties:** Executes semantics directly; unforgeable.  

---

### **Programmable Trust Fabric**  
- **Definition:** Substrate-native framework binding identity, claims, and execution.  
- **Scope:** Attestations, revocation, ZKP, device-bound trust.  
- **Properties:** Autonomous, cryptographic, substrate-enforced.  

---

### **Cortex**  
- **Definition:** Federated semantic + governance layer above Layer0.  
- **Scope:** SCI as coordinating umbrella.  
- **Properties:** Advises but cannot alter substrate execution.  

---

### **Substrate**  
- **Definition:** The foundational layer where meaning is encoded and executed.  
- **Scope:** Evolves historically: physical → biological → symbolic → digital → trust.  
- **Properties:** Each stage inherits from the prior; only Sem0 closes the incorruptibility gap.  

---

## Versioning Rules  
- Ontology terms are **append-only**: definitions may be extended but not contradicted.  
- Changes require:  
  - Timestamped declaration.  
  - Multi-council review.  
  - Custodial attestation by Know.  

---

## Change Log  
- **v1.0 (2025-08-20):**  
  - First canonical ontology publication.  
  - Defines Know, Layer0, Sem0, SCI, councils, glyph logic, TSE, programmable trust fabric, cortex, substrate.  
  - Integrity: [OTS Timestamp](Ontology-v1.0.md.ots)  
  - SHA-256: `[placeholder until stamped]`
