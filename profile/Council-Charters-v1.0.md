## Part I — Universal Charter (Applies to All Councils)  

### 1. Nature of Councils  
Councils are **federated governance units** of SCI.  
They exist to advise, propose, and maintain domain-specific standards.  
They do not own execution — execution belongs solely to **Know/Layer0 (Pnode)**.  

### 2. Baseline Repositories  
- Each domain has a **baseline repo**, authored and timestamped by its custodian.  
- Custodianship remains indivisible: repos cannot be seized or fork-claimed as canonical.  
- Councils maintain proposals, reviews, and drafts — the custodian merges or rejects.  

### 3. Membership Rules  
- Membership is **merit-based**, demonstrable through timestamped contributions.  
- Membership is **revocable without notice** for breach, capture, or corruption.  
- No council may self-appoint permanent members. All legitimacy is provisional.  

### 4. Authority Boundaries  
- **Councils govern semantics; they do not govern execution.**  
- Councils may propose evolution of primitives, but execution must remain incorruptible.  
- No council may impose control over Layer0.  

### 5. Lifecycle  
- **Creation:** new councils may be proposed by timestamped declaration + multi-council acknowledgement.  
- **Succession:** custody of a council may change only by timestamped attestation + consensus.  
- **Dissolution:** councils may dissolve, but their repos remain preserved for audit.  

### 6. Integrity Guarantees  
- All council actions are timestamped, auditable, and tamper-evident.  
- No unsigned deliberation is canonical.  
- Transparency is enforced: logs public, operations visible, private discussions optional.

## Part II — Domain-Specific Charters  

### 2.1 Semantics Council Charter  
**Scope:** glyph logic, hybrid semantics, and **True Substrate Encoding (TSE)**.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Prevent **semantic drift** across SCI domains.  
- Maintain evolution of the **root grammar of civilization**.  
- Define standards for meaning representation across humans, machines, and agents.  

---

### 2.2 Identity & Attestation Council Charter  
**Scope:** decentralized identifiers (DID), verifiable credentials (VC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), and device binding.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Maintain self-sovereign identity standards.  
- Define attestation protocols and revocation systems.  
- Ensure that **identity is indivisible and cryptographically provable**.  

---

### 2.3 Networks Council Charter  
**Scope:** topology, routing, failure tolerance, sovereign connectivity.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Design resilient networks immune to capture and coercion.  
- Ensure **post-fragility communications** across sovereign nodes.  
- Maintain interoperability with semantics and identity primitives.  

---

### 2.4 Data Council Charter  
**Scope:** verifiable storage, ZKP-bound data, edge validation.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Guard against **epistemic drift**.  
- Ensure data immutability, revocability, and self-verifying provenance.  
- Maintain protocols for user-owned data sovereignty.  

---

### 2.5 Security Council Charter  
**Scope:** substrate-native defenses, attack-surface minimization, inference protections.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Prevent capture, tampering, unauthorized inference.  
- Define **forbidden modes** (surveillance without consent, coercive execution, backdoors).  
- Maintain the immune system of SCI.  

---

### 2.6 Compliance Council Charter  
**Scope:** programmable, jurisdiction-aware enforcement.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Encode legal frameworks as verifiable, substrate-compatible policies.  
- Prevent central choke points in rule enforcement.  
- Harmonize multi-jurisdictional rules without coercive authority.  

---

### 2.7 Planetary Systems Council Charter  
**Scope:** environmental sensing, planetary coordination, and climate feedback.  
**Responsibilities:**  
- Maintain verifiable planetary-scale data semantics.  
- Ensure **semantic integrity of environmental signals**.  
- Coordinate governance for shared planetary resources.  

---

## Part III — Closing Declaration  
Councils federate, but they do not rule.  
They advise, but they do not execute.  
Execution belongs only to **Know (Pnode)** — the incorruptible substrate.  

SCI is sovereign not because of councils, but because of its architecture:  
- The **substrate is permanent**.  
- The **cortex is federated**.  
- The **future is open**.  

---

## Change Log  
- **v1.0 (2025-08-20):**  
  - First canonical publication of SCI’s Council Charters.  
  - Defines universal rules for all councils.  
  - Establishes domain-specific charters for seven domains.  
  - Integrity: [OTS Timestamp](Council-Charters-v1.0.md.ots)  
  - SHA-256: `[placeholder until stamped]`
